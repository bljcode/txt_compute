txt_compute  Wish someone help me make it better 
===========

the computer use txt as input,  compute the result of every line. 
It can also support "(" and ")" except for normal input .But not support negative number
It can give out some error information when the input line is bad(eg: /0, float%).but not all
There is maybe some other bug I can't find ......
